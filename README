Hi, thanks for reading me!

The data is being retrieved from HPWREN sensor towers using WXT520 sensors.

for my information please visit:

To do list:

1) Make the graphView cleaner:

* Some lines are thinker than others because
of how I made it.

* when there is no data the lines just
go down which looks strange. 

* Get that extra dot in there. 

* Change the way it updates so that it pushes dots down
instead of updating in a loop. 

* Change the background so its static, as to not kill the
battery.

2) remove or replace the settings button:

* Thinking to add a small manual to help explain
the application a little better, but then it doesn't
need its own button, it could go to a menu option, 
but then again there would be a lot of free space not 
being used.
