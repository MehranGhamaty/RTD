Hi, thanks for reading me!

The data is being retrieved from HPWREN sensor towers using WXT520 sensors.

To do list:

Make the graphView cleaner:

Some lines are thinker than others because
of how I made it, connecting lines go over
dots, when there is no data the lines just
go down which looks strange. Should just
connect two dots with blank inbetween. Also
need to add a title of the location and type
of graph. Get that extra dot in there. Change
the way it updates so that it pushes dots down
instead of updating in a loop. Also should change
the background so its static, as to not kill the
battery.

Fix location:

make it so that the options go to the right 
type for graphView.

remove or fix the map class:

Just doesn't work right now, need to update it 
a little or just get rid of it.

remove or replace the settings button:

Thinking to add a small manual to help explain
the application a little better, but then it doesn't
need its own button, it could go to a menu option, 
but then again there would be a lot of free space not 
being used.
